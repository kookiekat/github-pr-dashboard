See pull requests at a glance, across multiple repos

# Configuration

Copy the file `src/config/config.json.sample` to `src/config/config.json`. If you are accessing public GitHub, you don't need to change the `apiBaseUrl` option. If you are accessing a GitHub Enterprise instance, you will need to set `apiBaseUrl` to the base URL of your GitHub Enterprise installation, e.g. `https://github.mycompany.com/api/v3`.

Under the `repos` option, list all the repositories from which you want to see pull requests. The repository should be given in the format `owner/repoName`, e.g. `joeattardi/github-pr-dashboard`.

GitHub places a very strict rate limit on unauthenticated requests. If you run into this problem, you will need to add [auth token](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.8/v3/auth/#basic-authentication) in `config.json`.

## Example `config.json`

```json
{
  "apiBaseUrl": "https://api.github.com",
  "token": "1234abcd5678efgh9012ijkl",
  "repos": [
    "joeattardi/github-pr-dashboard",
    "joeattardi/promise-poller",
    "joeattardi/tailstreamer"
  ]
}
```

## Displaying üëç and üëé Comment Counts

Maybe your team has some code review guidelines expressed through comments. For example, a pull request has to have at least one "+1" or "üëç" comments and no "-1" or "üëé" comments. You can configure the dashboard to display the positive and negative comment counts in the `comments` section:

```json
{
  ...
  "comments": {
    "positive": [
      ":+1:"
    ],
    "negative": [
      ":-1:"
    ]
  }
}
```

And the result will look like this:

Now you can quickly glance at which pull requests are ready to merge and which ones need attention.

You can use the short-codes for any GitHub emoji - make üíÉ (dancer) positive and üåµ (cactus) negative, go nuts!

## Displaying Reaction Counts

Should work automatically. Reactions will also count towards your postive and negative totals if using that feature. If you want to disable the reaction feature, simply add reactions: false to your config json

# Local Environment

## Setup 

Use the `config.json.sample` file to create a new file called `config.json` with the configuration and options to run this application. 

### Setup parameters
 
 * "apiBaseUrl" : Base Rest Api which will be used
 * "toke": Auth Token for [Basic Auth](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.8/v3/auth/#basic-authentication)
 * "groupByRepo":  Use this option with true value for group the results by repository ( true | false )
 * "repos": Repositories that the application should fetch the requests
 * "comments": Displaying üëç and üëé Comment Counts

## Building

After you have configured the dashboard, run `webpack` to build the app. The result will be in the `dist` directory, which you can then copy into your web server to serve it from.

 * Command line : `$ npm run dev-build`

## Starting

 * Run the build : `$ npm run dev-build`
 * Run the start script: `$ npm run start`
 * Go to: http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

## Testing

This project use Karma to run test tasks. To run all tests you should run the command: $ npm run test
To know more about Karma: https://www.npmjs.com/package/karma

## Notes:

 * After build the project you can check the `index.html` into `./dist/` directory
 * To clean the generated files execute the clean script: `$ npm run clean`
 * To linting the project run: `$ npm run lint`
